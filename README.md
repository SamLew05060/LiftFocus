## 🧩 The Problem We Solve

Life moves fast. Between work, school, family, and everything else, taking care of yourself often comes last.

Most people want to:
- Feel stronger and more energetic
- Move their body regularly
- Eat better without cooking or dieting

But they struggle because:
- There’s no time
- Workouts feel too long or hard
- Healthy food seems expensive or complicated

We get it. That’s why LiftFocus isn’t about perfection — it’s about progress.
